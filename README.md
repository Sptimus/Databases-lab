# 📌 Databases Lab

## 🔍 Course Overview
The **Databases Lab** course is designed to provide students with a hands-on approach to working with databases, focusing on both relational and NoSQL systems. This course will cover fundamental and advanced database concepts, including modeling, SQL optimization, database administration, and modern database technologies.

Students will gain practical experience in designing, managing, and optimizing databases through a series of structured lab exercises and assignments.

## 📖 Course Topics
This course will be divided into the following key areas:

### 1️⃣ Advanced Data Modeling
- Extended ER diagrams (multi-valued attributes, many-to-many relationships, generalization, and specialization)
- Transformation of ER models into relational models
- Denormalization and designing efficient data structures

### 2️⃣ Advanced SQL
- Views and their applications in databases
- Use of stored procedures and user-defined functions
- Triggers – mechanisms and applications
- SQL query optimization (indexes, query execution plans, SQL caching)
- SQL security and access control management

### 3️⃣ Database Administration & Management
- Transaction mechanisms in databases – ACID properties, isolation levels, and locking
- Data replication and partitioning techniques
- Database clusters and high availability strategies
- Backup and recovery mechanisms
- Database monitoring and performance tuning

### 4️⃣ NoSQL Technologies – In-Depth Analysis
- Comparison of relational and non-relational database systems
- Advanced concepts in graph databases (Neo4j, ArangoDB)
- Columnar databases (Apache Cassandra, HBase)
- NewSQL – modern relational database approaches
- CAP Theorem and its impact on database selection

### 5️⃣ Modern Database Trends & Technologies
- Serverless database models
- Modern indexing mechanisms (B+Tree, LSM-Tree, Bloom Filters)
- Advanced data analytics techniques in databases
- Applications of AI & ML in database management

## 🔧 Course Requirements
- Basic understanding of SQL and relational databases
- Familiarity with a programming language (e.g., Python, Java, or C#) for database interaction
- Willingness to explore both relational and NoSQL paradigms

## 📂 Repository Structure
This repository will contain:
- **Lab exercises** with step-by-step instructions
- **SQL scripts** for practice and demonstration
- **Assignments** to reinforce key concepts
- **Reference materials** and best practices

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/databases-lab.git
   ```
2. Set up the required database environment (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Neo4j, etc.).
3. Follow the lab instructions in each section.
